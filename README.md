## 2Do Box

#### Synopsis

For this project we pivoted our IdeaBox ideas and turned it into a 2DoBox.
2DoBox relies on a similar principle: user's can enter in a new 2Do task and have it saved to a page. It can be amended at any time by clicking the title or body text. One can assign a priority to the task from having low priority to critical priority. 2Do's can be sorted by completion or priority as well.
